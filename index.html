<p>
Voltus owns the utility data authorization and utility credential collection part of our joint Residential demand response signup flows. Here are some answers to common questions or issues that may arise. 
</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>


<h2>Q: Why is electricity usage data important for demand response? </h2>


<p>
To comply with program rules, Voltus is required to provide electricity usage data from the utility meter at each site being registered for demand response programs. Voltus uses this information once a year during registration, as well as during the program season after each demand response event. This data is necessary to define the site’s baseline energy usage and also to demonstrate that energy was in fact reduced during events.
</p>
<h1>The Task </h1>


<h2>Q: What are we asking customers to do? </h2>


<p>
To provide their utility account account credentials (username and password) to Arcadia via a webform. 
</p>
<p>
For CommonwealthEdison (ComEd) and PECO, we are also asking them to turn off 2 Step Verification before doing this, in order to make the data access connection last longer for Voltus, so we don’t need to bother them again. 
</p>
<h2>Q: How do PECO and COMED customers turn off 2 Step Verification? </h2>


<p>
For PECO, this is a <a href="https://sharemydata.voltus.co/help/mfa/peco">link</a> that can be shared with customers. 
</p>
<p>
For CommonwealthEdison (ComEd), this is a <a href="https://sharemydata.voltus.co/help/mfa/comed">link</a> that can be shared with customers. 
</p>
<h2>Q: Why do we have to ask customers to turn off 2 Step Verification? </h2>


<p>
To earn money for you in demand response, Voltus needs to see the readings from your utility meter throughout the year - a long-lived data connection. 2 Step Verification is designed to make data connections short-lived (lasting less than a day) so 2 Step Verification needs to be turned off to give a full year of data.

<h2 id="q-is-connection-to-the-utility-account-absolutely-necessary-is-turning-off-2-step-verification-absolutely-necessary">Q: Is connection to the utility account absolutely necessary? Is turning off 2 Step Verification absolutely necessary?</h2>


<p>
Yes, it is required for participation. Without this connection to the utility account, Voltus will not be able to confirm your demand response performance and pay customers their participation incentive or enroll them for sweepstakes entries.

<p>
Solution TBD

<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>


<h2>Q: I am seeing an error message on the form that says “Something went wrong.” What should I do? </h2>


<p>
This likely means that your utility account credentials are incorrect. 
</p>
<h2 id="q-i-do-not-have-the-utility-account-credentials-or-i-am-not-comfortable-asking-someone-else-to-share-their-credentials-with-me">Q: I do not have the utility account credentials or I am not comfortable asking someone else to share their credentials with me.</h2>


<p>
Please send the page link to the person who does have access to the credentials and ask them to fill out the form in order to participate. 
</p>
<h2 id="q-i-will-need-to-create-a-utility-login-first-what-email-address-should-i-use">Q: I will need to create a utility login first. What email address should I use?</h2>


<p>
You can use whatever email you prefer. 
</p>
<h2 id="q-what-if-there-are-multiple-sites-homes-under-the-same-utility-account-for-the-customer-contact-but-not-all-of-the-sites-they-want-to-enroll-with-voltus">Q: What if there are multiple sites (homes) under the same utility account for the customer contact but not all of the sites they want to enroll with Voltus?</h2>


<p>
The customer has to authorize data share for all of the sites to Voltus. There is no way for the customer to provide data for some meters but not others unfortunately.<br><br>
